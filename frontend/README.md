# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with create-react-app, no routing is used.
For styling Skeleton was used as simple and tiny css bundle.
To start run: `npm start`

Note: editing/adding start date field is not possible to make it this app simple (considering that additional packages need to be installed and configured).
