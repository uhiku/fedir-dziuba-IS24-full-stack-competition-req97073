# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with nestjs framework.
To start run: `npm start`

Few things to note:

1. products are stored in memory and generated dynamically.
2. swagger is available and generated dynamically based on routes and dto.
3. since injectable services are singletons, assume products are the same between server reload/restart
